# LaaS
Leaderboard as a Service

## Why would anyone need LaaS
Well, yes! Also, not everyone on earth needs React :stuck_out_tongue:

LaaS serves the purpose of providing an easy to use, plug&play
interaface to show scoreboard / leaderboard of an event. If you have
ever organized an event/quiz/contest, you would know how important
it is to have a leaderboard.

*Leaderboard encourages people to participate in the contest.*

## Why name "LaaS"
Why not? :smirk:

## Idea seems promising, show me some demo
It is lunch time right now, come back later :construction:.
